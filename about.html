            <p>Hello! Iâ€™m an enthusiastic student at Belen Jesuit with a deep passion for engineering, math, and science, which fuels my curiosity and drive for problem-solving. Currently serving as the Vice President of my school, I thrive on leadership and collaboration while balancing my role on the varsity football team. Outside of academics and athletics, I love spending my free time boating and golfing, which provide a refreshing balance to my busy life. My diverse interests and commitments shape who I am and keep me constantly engaged and motivated.
