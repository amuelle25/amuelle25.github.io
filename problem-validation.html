                <p>Coffin-Lowry Syndrome | National Institute of Neurological Disorders and stroke. Coffin-Lowry Syndrome.</p>
                <p>- Summary: Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by physical and mental deformities. Some facial features that are the result of Coffin-Lowry are slanted eyes, broad nose, and large ears. Neurological complications include seizures, hearing, speech, movement coordination, and the loss of the ability to walk. Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a rare disorder so doctors and researchers do not have much information about it.</p>
                <p>- Critique: This website provides general information about Coffin-Lowry. Understanding the symptoms and complications people may have are necessary in helping find ways to improve life quality. This website also explains that Coffin-Lowry impacts mobility. This is crucial to my research because knowing this allows me to understand just how important modding a car for Jorge.</p>
                <p>How do all-electric cars work?. Alternative Fuels Data Center: How Do All-Electric Cars Work? (n.d.). https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/how-do-all-electric-cars-work</p>
                <p>- Summary: Electric cars use an electric motor powered by a large battery pack instead of an internal combustion engine. They must be plugged into an electric power source to recharge. Key parts of an electric car are an auxiliary battery for accessories, a charge port, a DC/EC converter to manage voltage, an electric traction motor to drive the wheels, and an onboard charger that converts AC to DC for charging the battery. Other components are a power electronics controller for managing motor speed and torque, a thermal system, and a transmission to transfer mechanical power to the wheels.</p>
                <p>- Critique: This article explains the different components of an electric car. This is useful information as Jorge’s car is electric so modding the car will be easier with this information. Also, using this website will make building the new car easier as we will be able to understand the components of an electric car. However, this website does not explain how to add modifications to an electric car. Therefore, I will have to do more research on modifications. </p>
                <p>Vehicle systems overview. Be Car Care Aware. (2020, October 1). https://www.carcare.org/vehicle-systems-overview/ </p>
                <p>- Summary: A car’s battery helps ensure vehicle operation during driving. It stores electrical energy that is changed into mechanical energy to turn the engine on. The alternator replenishes the current used during star-up and powers the engine’s electrical system. In a car’s brake system, once the pedal is pushed, the force creates hydraulic pressure in the master cylinder. Hydraulic pressure forces the brake shoes against drums against rotors, creating friction that slows the car. The suspension system maintains the connection between the wheels and the vehicle’s frame, ensuring stability. The steering system translates input from the steering wheel to the steering components. A transmission optimizes the engine’s output based on speed and load.</p>
                <p>- Critique: This article gives great insight to the different parts of a vehicle. It has different sections for the different systems of a car. It gives useful information about the batteries, brake system, transmission, and steering & suspension. I was able to understand these systems, which will help me in the process of building the new car and modding the current car Jorge uses. However, it does not explain how to change or upgrade a system, causing me to research further on how to do this.</p>
