                <p>~Coffin-Lowry Syndrome | National Institute of Neurological Disorders and stroke. 
                    Coffin-Lowry Syndrome. (n.d.). https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/coffin-lowry-syndrome</p>
                <p>-- Summary: Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by physical and mental deformities. Some facial features that are the result of Coffin-Lowry are slanted eyes, broad nose, and large ears. Neurological complications include seizures, hearing, speech, movement coordination, and the loss of the ability to walk. Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a rare disorder so doctors and researchers do not have much information about it. </p>
                <p>-- Critique: This website provides general information about Coffin-Lowry. Understanding the symptoms and complications people may have are necessary in helping find ways to improve life quality. This website also explains that Coffin-Lowry impacts mobility. This is crucial to my research because knowing this allows me to understand just how important modding a car for Jorge. </p>
                <p>~How do all-electric cars work?. Alternative Fuels Data Center: How Do All-Electric Cars Work? (n.d.). https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/how-do-all-electric-cars-work </p>
                <p>-- Summary: Electric cars use an electric motor powered by a large battery pack instead of an internal combustion engine. They must be plugged into an electric power source to recharge. Key parts of an electric car are an auxiliary battery for accessories, a charge port, a DC/EC converter to manage voltage, an electric traction motor to drive the wheels, and an onboard charger that converts AC to DC for charging the battery. Other components are a power electronics controller for managing motor speed and torque, a thermal system, and a transmission to transfer mechanical power to the wheels.</p>
                <p>-- Critique: This article explains the different components of an electric car. This is useful information as Jorgeâ€™s car is electric so modding the car will be easier with this information. Also, using this website will make building the new car easier as we will be able to understand the components of an electric car. However, this website does not explain how to add modifications to an electric car. Therefore, I will have to do more research on modifications.</p>
