                <p>Source: Coffin-Lowry Syndrome | National Institute of Neurological Disorders and stroke. Coffin-Lowry Syndrome.</p>
                <p>- Summary: Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by physical and mental deformities. Some facial features that are the result of Coffin-Lowry are slanted eyes, broad nose, and large ears. Neurological complications include seizures, hearing, speech, movement coordination, and the loss of the ability to walk. Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a rare disorder so doctors and researchers do not have much information about it.</p>
                <p>- Critique: This website provides general information about Coffin-Lowry. Understanding the symptoms and complications people may have are necessary in helping find ways to improve life quality. This website also explains that Coffin-Lowry impacts mobility. This is crucial to my research because knowing this allows me to understand just how important modding a car for Jorge.</p>
                <p>Source: How do all-electric cars work?. Alternative Fuels Data Center: How Do All-Electric Cars Work? (n.d.). https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/how-do-all-electric-cars-work</p>
                <p>- Summary: Electric cars use an electric motor powered by a large battery pack instead of an internal combustion engine. They must be plugged into an electric power source to recharge. Key parts of an electric car are an auxiliary battery for accessories, a charge port, a DC/EC converter to manage voltage, an electric traction motor to drive the wheels, and an onboard charger that converts AC to DC for charging the battery. Other components are a power electronics controller for managing motor speed and torque, a thermal system, and a transmission to transfer mechanical power to the wheels.</p>
                <p>- Critique: This article explains the different components of an electric car. This is useful information as Jorge’s car is electric so modding the car will be easier with this information. Also, using this website will make building the new car easier as we will be able to understand the components of an electric car. However, this website does not explain how to add modifications to an electric car. Therefore, I will have to do more research on modifications. </p>
                <p>Source: Vehicle systems overview. Be Car Care Aware. (2020, October 1). https://www.carcare.org/vehicle-systems-overview/ </p>
                <p>- Summary: A car’s battery helps ensure vehicle operation during driving. It stores electrical energy that is changed into mechanical energy to turn the engine on. The alternator replenishes the current used during star-up and powers the engine’s electrical system. In a car’s brake system, once the pedal is pushed, the force creates hydraulic pressure in the master cylinder. Hydraulic pressure forces the brake shoes against drums against rotors, creating friction that slows the car. The suspension system maintains the connection between the wheels and the vehicle’s frame, ensuring stability. The steering system translates input from the steering wheel to the steering components. A transmission optimizes the engine’s output based on speed and load.</p>
                <p>- Critique: This article gives great insight to the different parts of a vehicle. It has different sections for the different systems of a car. It gives useful information about the batteries, brake system, transmission, and steering & suspension. I was able to understand these systems, which will help me in the process of building the new car and modding the current car Jorge uses. However, it does not explain how to change or upgrade a system, causing me to research further on how to do this.</p>

                <h3>Patent Research</h3>
                <p>Source: Google. (n.d.). US20170351331A1 - systems and methods for haptic remote control gaming. Google Patents. https://patents.google.com/patent/US20170351331A1/en?q=%28RC%2Bcar%29&oq=RC%2Bcar8202965f34%2FUS20170351331A1.pdf </p>
                <p>- Summary: A remotely controllable device connects to a remote control through a wireless link, letting an operator control it from a distance. Some of these devices come with cameras that send video data back to the remote control, allowing the operator to see what the camera sees on a display. The document talks about systems and methods for haptic remote control gaming, where a portable multifunction device acts as the remote. The smartphone is able to receive information from the RC car while being able to control it. This device collects information from the controllable device, figures out a haptic effect (like vibrations) based on that info, and sends a signal to create that effect.</p>
                <p>- Critique: The document looks at different ways to implement this system and the benefits it offers through various examples. It is really informative on how to use a remote control to control an electrical system. This will be very helpful when connecting the RC remote control and Jose’s phone.</p>
                <p>Source: Google. (n.d.-a). CA2664775C - ATV Safety System. Google Patents. https://patents.google.com/patent/CA2664775C/en?q=%28ATV%2Bsafety%29&oq=ATV%2Bsafety </p>
                <p>- Summary: The design presents a new roll bar system for ATVs that aims to improve safety and functionality. This system features a sturdy roll bar shaped like an arch, made from tubing and connected to the ATV frame. It includes a flexible seat back and support beams for extra stability. Important parts of the system are a seat belt with connectors and a retractable mechanism that locks and unlocks for secure use. It also has a collapsible emergency shelter, a footrest guard, and a tilt sensor that checks how tilted the ATV is to avoid rollovers, sounding an alarm if it gets too tilted. Overall, this roll bar system makes ATVs safer with smart design and protective features.</p>
                <p>- Critique: This design seems very safe. Safety is one of the most important factors when building and modding the car. This design gives insight on how to make the car more safe so that Jorge has fun while staying safe. However Jorge’s car isn't exactly like an ATV, so we will have to adjust to make sure safety is ensured.</p>
                <p>Source: Google. (n.d.-b). CA3091237C - all-terrain vehicle. Google Patents. https://patents.google.com/patent/CA3091237C/en?q=%28All-terrain%2Bvehichles%29&oq=All-terrain%2Bvehichles</p>
                <p>- Summary: The method for making ATVs starts with putting together a frame that has front and back parts. Then, a powertrain is attached, which includes the main engine, transmission, and final drives. Next, different lengths of suspension components and half shafts are used to create ATVs in various widths. The process involves picking the right parts to get the specific widths needed, and then adding front and rear wheels, along with steering mechanisms and stops to fit the different suspension lengths. It is evident how flexible and adaptable these all-terrain vehicles can be for different widths and performance needs.</p>
                <p>- Critique: This information is very useful for when we start building the rest of the new car. It gives the process on how to build an ATV. Understanding the design and how to build the ATV is necessary. We will have to adjust certain aspects of the design, like the dimensions. We will also have to work with an electric vehicle, not fuel powered.</p>
