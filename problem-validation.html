                    Coffin-Lowry Syndrome. (n.d.). https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/coffin-lowry-syndrome</p>
                <p>-- Summary: Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by physical and mental deformities. Some facial features that are the result of Coffin-Lowry are slanted eyes, broad nose, and large ears. Neurological complications include seizures, hearing, speech, movement coordination, and the loss of the ability to walk. Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a rare disorder so doctors and researchers do not have much information about it. </p>
                <p>-- Critique: This website provides general information about Coffin-Lowry. Understanding the symptoms and complications people may have are necessary in helping find ways to improve life quality. This website also explains that Coffin-Lowry impacts mobility. This is crucial to my research because knowing this allows me to understand just how important modding a car for Jorge. </p>
