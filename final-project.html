                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>Jorge grapples with the challenges imposed by Coffin-Lowry Syndrome (CLS), impacting his mobility, communication, and focus. His attention struggles to center on a singular focus, and it has become evident that his solace lies in a toy car. Unfortunately, existing vehicles in the market fail to meet his unique mechanical and physical requirements,  consistent and reliable remote control, lacking nocturnal lighting, and providing inadequate space. To address these issues, we propose a custom vehicle with features like a screen holder and hitch attachment, tailored to Jorge's needs. This specialized conveyance will possess the necessary power and suspension for traversing the challenging terrains around his home. Encouragingly, our efforts have garnered support from other families facing similar circumstances, who believe that this customized vehicle will provide comparable benefits to their children..</p>
